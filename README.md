Learning to Deep Learning is in progress! :)

## Examples in the Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet
01- [imdb-set.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/imdb-set.ipynb): Binary Classification (IMDB set)        
- It includes network size effect on training and validation loss. It may be important to avoid overfitting or underfitting.  
- *Step 09:* Dropout Effect is studied as different dropout rates and its effect on the different size networks (from CH4).
  
02- [reuters-muliclass.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/reuters-multiclass.ipynb): Multiclass Classification (Reuters set)  
03- [regression-price-prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/regression-price-prediction.ipynb): Regression (Boston Housing set)  
  - *Step 09:* Adding weight regularization (from CH4).

## In [Practice](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/tree/main/practice):
01- [basic-perceptron.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/practice/basic-perceptron.ipynb): The script is presented how an ANN model works fundamentally.
