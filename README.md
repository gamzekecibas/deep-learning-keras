Training process for deep learning with Keras

Deep Learning trainings:
-------------------------
01- imdb-set.ipyb: Binary Classification (IMDB set)        
- It includes network size effect on training and validation loss. It may be important to avoid overfitting or underfitting.  
- *Step 09:* Dropout Effect is studied as different dropout rates and its effect on the different size networks (from CH4).
  
02- reuters-muliclass.ipynb: Multiclass Classification (Reuters set)  
03- regression-price-prediction.ipyb: Regression (Boston Housing set)  
  - *Step 09:* Adding weight regularization (from CH4).
