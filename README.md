Learning to Deep Learning is in progress! :)

## Examples in the Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet
- [01-binary-classification.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/imdb-set.ipynb): Binary Classification (IMDB set)        
  
- [02-multiclass-classification.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/reuters-multiclass.ipynb): Multiclass Classification (Reuters set)
- [03-binary-classification-iterations](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/04-binary-classification-iterations.ipynb): Different validations are investigated.
   - It includes *network size effect* on training and validation loss. It may be important to avoid overfitting or underfitting.  
  - *Dropout Effect* is studied as different dropout rates and its effect on the different size networks (from CH4).
- [04-regression.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/regression-price-prediction.ipynb): Regression (Boston Housing set)  
  - *Step 09:* Adding weight regularization (from CH4).

## In [Practice](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/tree/main/practice):
- [01-basic-perceptron.ipynb](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/practice/basic-perceptron.ipynb): The script is presented how an ANN model works fundamentally.
- [02-computer_vision.py](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/practice/02-computer_vision.py): Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) study with CIFAR-10 dataset. It is a Google Colab project.
- [03-perceptron-fundamentals](https://github.com/gamzekecibas/deep-learning-keras/blob/main/practice/03-perceptron-fundamentals.ipynb): Fundamentals of neural networks with logical operations by [mcobanov](https://github.com/cobanov)'s study.
